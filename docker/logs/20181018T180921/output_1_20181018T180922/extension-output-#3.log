Failed to load the ESLint library for the document /home/abn/my-projects/habee_project/habee/backend/api/controllers/eventController.js

To use ESLint please install eslint by running 'npm install eslint' in the workspace folder habee
or globally using 'npm install -g eslint'. You need to reopen the workspace after installing eslint.

If you are using yarn instead of npm set the setting `"eslint.packageManager": "yarn"`

Alternatively you can disable ESLint for the workspace folder habee by executing the 'Disable ESLint' command.
